                My name is Thierry Harry with matrix number, 22002655. I am
                majoring in Computer Science (Multimedi Computing). This is my first time taking the
                Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
                subject. This is because although I didn't get that good of a grade in FOP, it's 
                always fun to try something new and more challenging.

                I acquired B- for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
                think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
                to do well in the subject, I will study way earlier compared to last time. Wish me luck!!!

        catch(Exception e)
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private static void part2()
    {
        try(PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(filename, true)))
        {
            writer.println("""

                It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did
                well in this course. I'm overall satisfied with my performance throughout the whole course. I learnt 
                many things while studying DS like how to code more and better which also subsequently made me type
                faster. I got exactly my target for my grade.
