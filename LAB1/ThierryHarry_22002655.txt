My name is Thierry Harry with matrix number, 22002655. I am
majoring in Computer Science (Multimedi Computing). This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because although I didn't get that good of a grade in FOP, it's
always fun to try something new and more challenging.

I acquired B- for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will study way earlier compared to last time. Wish me luck!!!

It’s me again. Finally, it’s the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did
well in this course. I'm overall satisfied with my performance throughout the whole course. I learnt
many things while studying DS like how to code more and better which also subsequently made me type
faster. I got exactly my target for my grade.
